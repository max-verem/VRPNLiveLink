# Usage
To use this plugin you need enable LiveLink plugin in your project and unpack binaries to **Plugins** folder of your UE4 installation.

## Setup plugin.

Add VRPN tracker source:

![Add Live source](/docs/cfg-0010.png?raw=true "Add Live source")

Provided string specify tracker name and host of VRPN server.

After pressing **OK** button you will see a status of incoming datas:

![Incoming data status](/docs/cfg-0020.png?raw=true "Incoming data status")

Image above shows that plugin is receiving incoming datas.

At this step plugin setup is compleate and you can follow next step.

## LiveLink data usage.

After plugin setup you need to assign a data stream it provides to an actor or it component.

In our example we will use **CineCameraActor** to control.

![target to control](/docs/cfg-0030.png?raw=true "target to control")

To assign LiveLink data to camera, you need to add a LiveLink controller component to your actor:

![LiveLink controller](/docs/cfg-0040.png?raw=true "LiveLink controller")

Setup LiveLink component to use data:

![Setup LiveLink component to use data](/docs/cfg-0050.png?raw=true "Setup LiveLink component to use data")

After selecting data stream, LiveLink will apply a transformation from that stream to Camera/Scene component of CineCamera you selected (does not mean which one you selected, because both accept *transfor*)

Another thing you need to keep in mind during configuration is Relative/World transformation been applied:

![World Transform](/docs/cfg-0060.png?raw=true "World Transform")

Uncheck option **World Transform** - you actor will have local Location/Rotation exact as data incoming from VRPN tracker.
